          How to Use and Store Laundry Detergent Packs Correctly
        </h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>
          The average American household does 400 loads every year. Since the
          beginning of automated washing machines, powdered detergent (and then
          liquid detergent) have always been used to get clothes clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in early 2012, concentrated liquid laundry packets came on the
          market and changed the way many of us do laundry. Smaller, easier, and
          more convenient, these little concentrated laundry detergent packets
          can pack quite the cleaning punch. But are you getting the most out of
          your laundry packets?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is actually a little learning curve when it comes to safely and
          effectively using this relatively new detergent technology and so
          today I want to share some best practices when it comes to using
          concentrated laundry packets.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 class="my-2">Advantages of Laundry Packets</h4>
        <p>
          Laundry packets contain concentrated laundry detergent, so one packet
          per load is what you need most of the time. Packets typically contain
          a detergent in a water-soluble film wrapper. (Although you can now
          also find single-use scent boosters, detergent boosters, and stain
          removers as well.) They deliver great cleaning power in a
          pre-measured, mess-free, easy-to-use package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since they are highly concentrated, they are much smaller and lighter
          than the equivalent amount of liquid or powdered detergent. A typical
          liquid laundry bottle weighs 7 pounds, while a package of concentrated
          laundry packets only weighs 3.5 pounds for the same number of loads.
        </p>
        <p>
          This concentrated size and lighter weight is a big advantage when it
          comes to storage and transportation. People who need to transport
          their laundry and detergent long distances can really appreciate this
          weight and space savings. Apartment dwellers, for example, who might
          otherwise have to lug a hefty container to the local laundromat, can
          instead carry a container less than half that size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, concentrated laundry packets are also much faster to measure
          and use. Consumer Reports estimates an average consumer can save as
          much as a full hour of time over the course of a year vs. pouring and
          measuring liquid detergents and pretreats. Consumers also tend to
          conserve detergent when using laundry packets. There is less risk of
          spillage, over-pouring too.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h4 class="my-2">Proper Storage and Care of Laundry Packets</h4>
        <p>
          Liquid laundry packets can be harmful if swallowed or get in the eyes,
          so they should ALWAYS be stored high and out of reach of pets and
          children, preferably in a locked cabinet. NEVER store laundry packets
          on open shelves, on the floor, or on top of washers and dryers.
          Keeping laundry packets out of view of children reduces their
          temptation to interact with them and can greatly reduce the risk of
          accidental exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Packets should always be kept in their original containers with their
          labels intact. The lids should be closed and secured when not in use.
          Get in the habit of snapping the lid shut every time you take a packet
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid storing packets in areas of high humidity, which can cause them
          to stick together or even break open. Packets should always be handled
          with dry hands. Never attempt to “rinse” off a packet.
        </p>
        <p>
          NEVER allow children to handle packets, even if they are “helping”
          with laundry. Packets should only be used by adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not reuse laundry packet containers and packaging for storage or
          crafting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do keep poison controls number on hand, and consider adding it to your
          cell phone.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h4 class="my-2">Usage Tips for Laundry Packets</h4>
        <p>
          You want to place your detergent packet(s) at the bottom of the
          washer, directly to the drum, and then add your clothes on top of it.
          Don’t add packets on top of clothes since they are less likely to come
          in contact with enough water to completely dissolve them. This can
          result in streaks and deposits on your clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Avoid putting laundry packets into detergent dispensers, since you
          risk clogging the dispensers and flooding your machine.
        </p>
        <p>Don’t use pods in detergent dispenser.</p>
        <p>
          Do not cut, tear, or open packets; they are designed to dissolve in
          water.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are having a problem with your laundry packets not dissolving,
          it could be because your water is too hard, too cold, or your agitator
          is broken. It also could be because you have added too many clothes to
          your machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Save yourself some work and time washing those 400 loads of laundry
          every year, with the use of laundry packets! Getting laundry clean
          with concentrated detergent packets quickly and easily as well as
          safely is not difficult if you use and store them properly. Most
          consumers that run into problems with their laundry packets are not
          following the manufacturer’s instructions or guidelines. Making sure
          you store them high and out of view of children also is important if
          you want to have a safe and accident-free laundry room.
