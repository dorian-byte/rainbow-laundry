          How to Get Makeup Out of Clothes
        </h1>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>
          One truth universally acknowledged is that regardless of your level of
          hand-eye coordination, makeup spills and smudges are bound to happen.
          And when they do, you’re left wondering how to get makeup out of
          clothes, ideally without making the stain look worse. We’ve got eight
          genius solutions for getting makeup stains out of your clothes fast
          and easy.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Use a Makeup Wipe</strong><br />
            Makeup wipes don’t just work on your face–they can actually help get
            makeup off your clothes. It’s an old backstage trick you can
            occasionally spot at fashion shows when makeup artists realize
            they’ve smeared something on themselves while trying to protect the
            models’ clothes. It’s sneaky and it works. Just grab one and gently
            blot or rub until the offending makeup stain is lifted away.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Rubbing Alcohol</strong><br />
            Soak a cotton ball or the tip of a washcloth in rubbing alcohol and
            then rub it over the makeup stain. Rubbing alcohol is particularly
            effective at removing lipstick stains, since alcohol can break down
            oily and waxy stains.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Shaving Cream</strong><br />
            Who knew shaving cream can lift a stain? Apply a squirt or two the
            stain and let it sit for ten minutes. During that time, the cream
            will dissolve the stain. After ten minutes, wipe off the shaving
            cream with cold water.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>A Blow Dryer</strong><br />
            If you use any kind of loose powder on your face, you know how
            frustrating it can be if you spill it on your clothes (especially if
            it’s light powder on dark fabric). Any attempt to wipe it away is
            met with a smeared mess that’s even more noticeable than the
            original dots of powder were. So what do you? Grab a blow dryer.
            Blast the powder off the fabric and you’re good to go.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Hairspray</strong><br />
            Who knew? Hairspray can actually help you get rid of a tricky
            lipstick stain. Apply hairspray to the stain and let it dry. Let the
            hairspray dry and follow up with a wet wipe. Note: this only works
            if the hairspray contains alcohol. Alcohol-free hairsprays will do
            nothing for a makeup stain.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Ice, Ice Baby</strong><br />
            Applying ice cubes is another way to get makeup out of clothes. Grab
            a cube and rub it vigorously on stain. Ice (and cold water) works to
            lift a stain, while using hot water during a spot treatment can
            actually spread the stain. Avoid hot water at all costs when trying
            to spot treat a minor makeup stain. Save the hot water for when you
            toss in the washer.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Soap and Water</strong><br />
            If all you have on hand is soap and water, you can still try to get
            a makeup stain out. Just don’t grab a paper towel or napkin.
            Instead, dab cold water on the stain and the teensiest spot of soap.
            Then, rub the fabric against itself and allow the friction to lift
            the stain. This is better than using a paper product, as it can
            flake off and leave the fabric smeared with little white bits,
            potentially make the stained area look even worse until you’re able
            to give it a proper washing.
          </li>

          <li class="my-2">
            <strong>Detergent Pens and Detergent Wipes</strong><br />
            Designed for treating stains on the go, detergent pens like Tide to
            Go can provide a quick fix. For the best result, make sure to blot
            off any excess gunk off your fabric before taking applying the pen
            to it. When you press the tip into the clothing, the detergent
            solution will come out. Rub the tip of the detergent pen against the
            fabric until the stain starts to come off. Then, wipe off any extra
            solution. Detergent pens are reusable and safe to apply to most
            fabrics, including those labeled “dry clean only.”
