      <h3 class="mt-3">Express Machines</h3>
      <p>
        At Rainbow Laundry we understand that nobody wants to do their laundry.
        That is why we simplified the process to help get you back to your life.
        Take full advantage of our brand new Express Washing and Drying Machines
        with three times the capacity of your average washer or dryer. You will
        be able to tackle your loads of clothes three times faster than before.
        Not only do our machines have a larger capacity but they also work
        harder and use less water. Less water means less wear and tear on your
        clothing as well as even faster drying times.
